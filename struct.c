// What are C structs (Structures)

// With structs, you can group related variables in one place.
// Each variable in the struct is know as a MEMBER of the struct.

// Unlike an array, a struct can contain different data type (int, float, char)

// struct Keyword
// declare each membre inside curly braces

struct MyStructure {    // Structure declaration
    int     myNum;      // Member (int variable)
    char    myLetter;   // My letter
};                      // End the structure with a semicolon
